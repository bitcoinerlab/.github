# BitcoinerLAB

## Introduction
Welcome to BitcoinerLAB, dedicated to making Bitcoin development easier and more accessible. We provide a suite of JavaScript/TypeScript modules that streamline the creation of Bitcoin applications.

We are focused on utilizing the latest Bitcoin technologies, particularly Bitcoin Descriptors and Miniscript, to advance Bitcoin app development.

## About Us
At BitcoinerLAB, we began our journey while crafting a Bitcoin cold storage time-lock wallet. Our aim is to share our developed modules with the wider community, facilitating the creation of diverse Bitcoin applications and wallets.

### The Team
- **Jose-Luis Landabaso**: Founder of BitcoinerLAB, holding a Telecom Engineering degree and a PhD in Computer Vision. Currently focused on developing secure Bitcoin Vault solutions through BitcoinerLab.


## Our Projects & Modules

At BitcoinerLAB, we offer a comprehensive range of open-source libraries and projects, each tailored to enhance Bitcoin application development:

### Libraries (Modules)
These core tools provide essential functionalities for Bitcoin application development:
1. [**Descriptors**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/descriptors): For parsing and signing Bitcoin descriptors, including Miniscript expressions.
2. [**Discovery**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/discovery): Assists in retrieving data from the Bitcoin network. It supports querying using Bitcoin descriptors.
3. [**Coinselect**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/coinselect): For UTXO selection. It leverages Descriptors to define inputs and outputs.
4. [**Miniscript**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/miniscript): A compiler and standalone Satisfier for Bitcoin Miniscript.
5. [**Explorer**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/explorer): Provides unified access to Electrum and Esplora servers for retrieving blockchain data.
6. [**Secp256k1**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/secp256k1): Facilitates cryptographic functions for elliptic curve operations on the secp256k1 curve.

### Projects
These are practical applications and demonstrations of our libraries:
1. **Playground**: Interactive, browser-based demos for learning Bitcoin transactions without installation. These demos are used extensively in the [guides available on our site](https://bitcoinerlab.com/guides).
2. [**Vault Showcase**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/VaultShowcase): A native mobile app demo project, showcasing the practical application of our libraries in creating a secure Bitcoin vault.
