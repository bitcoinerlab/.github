# BitcoinerLAB

## Introduction
Welcome to BitcoinerLAB, dedicated to making Bitcoin development easier and more accessible. We specialize in providing a suite of JavaScript/TypeScript modules that streamline the creation of Bitcoin applications. Embracing the latest in Bitcoin technology, we are excited about the potential of Bitcoin Descriptors, especially those based on Miniscript, to transform the landscape of Bitcoin app development. Our tools are designed to unlock these new capabilities for developers, fostering innovation and efficiency in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## About Us
At BitcoinerLAB, we began our journey while crafting a Bitcoin cold storage time-lock wallet. Our aim is to share our developed modules with the wider community, facilitating the creation of diverse Bitcoin applications and wallets.

### The Team
- **Jose-Luis Landabaso**: Founder of BitcoinerLAB, holding a Telecom Engineering degree and a PhD in Computer Vision. Currently focused on developing secure Bitcoin Vault solutions through BitcoinerLab.


## Our Projects & Modules

At BitcoinerLAB, we offer a comprehensive range of open-source libraries and projects, each tailored to enhance Bitcoin application development:

### Libraries (Modules)
These core tools provide essential functionalities for Bitcoin application development:
1. [**Descriptors**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/descriptors): For parsing and signing Bitcoin descriptors, including Miniscript language elements.
2. [**Discovery**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/discovery): Assists in retrieving Bitcoin funds from ranged descriptors.
3. [**Coinselect**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/coinselect): Optimizes UTXO selection and transaction size calculations for Bitcoin transaction management.
4. [**Miniscript**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/miniscript): A compiler and standalone Satisfier for Bitcoin Miniscript.
5. [**Explorer**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/explorer): Provides unified access to Electrum and Esplora servers for retrieving blockchain data.
6. [**Secp256k1**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/secp256k1): Facilitates cryptographic functions for elliptic curve operations on the secp256k1 curve.

### Projects
These are practical applications and demonstrations of our libraries:
1. **Playground**: Interactive, browser-based demos for learning Bitcoin transactions without installation. [Explore Playgrounds](https://bitcoinerlab.com/guides)
2. [**Vault Showcase**](https://github.com/bitcoinerlab/VaultShowcase): A native mobile app demo project, showcasing the practical application of our libraries in creating a secure Bitcoin vault.
